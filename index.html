            Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
            other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal
            data.

            What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
            knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our
            privacy and freedom.

            But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple: An
            autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage
            powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation,
            and end-to-end encryption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Put even simpler —
            <strong>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</strong>
